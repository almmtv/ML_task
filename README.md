When running the finhub_data.py from the command line, you must specify the name of the stock you want to learn about.

analysis.ipynb creates a report on the analysis of historical data for the year.

prediction.py predicts the stock price using various regression methods (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, SVR, ElasticNetCV) and then evaluates the results using metrics such as explained variance score, max error, mean squared error, median absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and mean poisson deviance.
